Data Collection: Gather historical data on sinking incidents or similar situations. This data should include information about the individuals involved, their socio-economic status, age, gender, and whether they survived or not.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (like gender), and scaling numerical features if necessary.

Feature Selection: Determine which features (socio-economic status, age, gender, etc.) are most likely to be predictive of survival in sinking incidents. You may also engineer new features if needed.

Data Splitting: Split the data into a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the task. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines are some common choices for binary classification tasks like this.

Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data. The model will learn the patterns in the data that correlate with survival or sinking.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions for new individuals in similar situations. Provide the model with the relevant input features (socio-economic status, age, gender, etc.) to get a prediction of whether the person is likely to be safe or not.

Interpretation: Interpret the model's predictions and analyze which factors are most influential in determining safety. This can provide insights into what factors are likely to lead to success in such situations.

Deployment: If the model performs well, you can deploy it as part of a larger system or application to make real-time predictions.
